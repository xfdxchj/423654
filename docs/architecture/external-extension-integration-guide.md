# Guide: Integrating Tachiyomi and Mihon Extensions

This guide is intended for developers of other Android reader applications (such as forks of Kotatsu) who wish to integrate Tachiyomi, Mihon, or Aniyomi extension ecosystems into their own applications. Kototoro uses this approach to successfully map Mihon sources into its native framework.

## 1. Extension Discovery and Metadata Reading

Mihon/Tachiyomi extensions are installed as separate Android APKs. They are not executable apps but rather library packages.

**How to find them:**
You need to query the Android `PackageManager` to find installed packages that contain specific signatures or metadata.
- **Feature Flag**: Look for packages declaring the `tachiyomi.extension` feature.
- **Prefixes**: Extension package names usually contain `.extension`, `eu.kanade.tachiyomi.`, or `org.keiyoushi.`.
- **Metadata**: You need to extract `<meta-data>` from the `AndroidManifest.xml`, specifically `tachiyomi.extension.class` or `tachiyomi.extension.factory` to know which Kotlin class implements the `Source` interface.

**Important Android 11+ Gotcha:**
When calling `PackageManager.getPackageInfo(pkgName, PackageManager.GET_META_DATA)`, Android 11+ (API 30+) requires strict package visibility configuration. If you encounter missing metadata or `IllegalArgumentException`, ensure you handle package visibility queries correctly in your `AndroidManifest.xml` using the `<queries>` block. Furthermore, your broadcast receivers dealing with package events must be explicitly exported.

## 2. ClassLoader Isolation

Executing code from another APK safely is crucial to avoid dependency collisions.

**The Problem:**
If your app uses `okhttp 4.12.0` and the extension was compiled against `okhttp 3.12.0` or uses different Kotlin standard library versions, a direct load might cause `NoSuchMethodError` crashes.

**The Solution:**
Implement a **ChildFirstPathClassLoader**. When loading the extension's Dex file:
1. Try loading from the extension's APK first.
2. If not found, fall back to your parent application's ClassLoader.
3. *Exceptions:* Always delegate core shared libraries (like `kotlin.*`, `android.*`, and the interfaces `eu.kanade.tachiyomi.*`) to the parent ClassLoader. This ensures both your app and the extension reference the exact same underlying interface classes in memory.

## 3. Dependency Injection Bridging

Mihon extensions expect an `Application` context and specific networking instances (like `OkHttpClient`, `CookieJar`, `NetworkHelper`) to be provided by an internal dependency injector (Injekt or generic interfaces).

**How to Bridge:**
Before instantiating the extension's `Source` class, you must manually populate the shared registry with your own application's network instances.
1. Create a compat layer (e.g., an Injekt bridge if mirroring older architectures, or injecting directly into base Source references).
2. Bridge your Application `Context`, your `Json` serializer, and your `OkHttpClient`.
3. Provide a stub or wrapper for `NetworkHelper` that maps Mihon's interceptors into your app's networking layer.

*Note on Interceptors:* Mihon extensions rely on standard HTTP behaviors. If your app utilizes a customized interceptor chain (e.g., custom `GZipInterceptor`), ensure it doesn't conflict or cause double-decompression errors when the extension attempts to process encoded streams.

## 4. Model Conversion

Mihon's data models (`SManga`, `SChapter`, `Page`) likely don't perfectly align with your app's internal representations. Create a mapping layer that:
- Maps reading states (Ongoing, Completed, etc.).
- Converts filter lists safely to your internal search logic schemas.
- Maps chapters accurately. *Watch out for chapter order:* Mihon sources sometimes rely on reverse indexing. Ensure you enforce proper ascending or descending order when passing the lists into your UI.
- Resolves absolute URLs gracefully from relative paths (`HttpSource.getMangaUrl`).

## 5. Handling Source Updates

To provide a seamless experience, you need to react to extensions being installed, updated, or uninstalled dynamically while your app is running.

**Implementation:**
Register a `BroadcastReceiver` listening to standard Android package actions. Ensure you apply `addDataScheme("package")` to the IntentFilter:
- `Intent.ACTION_PACKAGE_ADDED`
- `Intent.ACTION_PACKAGE_REPLACED`
- `Intent.ACTION_PACKAGE_REMOVED`
- `Intent.ACTION_PACKAGE_FULLY_REMOVED`

*Gotcha:* Use `ContextCompat.registerReceiver(..., ContextCompat.RECEIVER_EXPORTED)` for receivers initialized at runtime to comply with recent Android 14+ security constraints. When triggered, debounce the event and rescan installed extensions in the background, updating your internal source registry dynamically.

## 6. Cloudflare & WebView Fallbacks

Many Tachiyomi sources rely heavily on Cloudflare bypasses and custom headers.
- **Cookies**: Ensure that cookies successfully resolved in your headless WebView (the `cf_clearance` cookie) are injected correctly into the shared `CookieJar` used by the mapped `OkHttpClient`.
- **Headers**: Extensions define internal `Headers` which often include specifically tailored `User-Agent` strings or Referer URLs. Pass these headers faithfully back into the WebView during challenge resolution and keep OkHttp perfectly synchronized, otherwise Cloudflare captures will fail.
