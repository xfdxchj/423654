# Local Import Guide

Kototoro supports importing local content directly into the application. Starting from the recent updates, you can explicitly pick whether to import your files as **Manga**, **Novel**, or **Video**. 

Depending on the file type, you can use either "Import File" for single instances or "Import Folder" for structured collections.

## Supported File Formats

When forcing a specific content type during import, the file extensions must match the supported formats for that media type. Otherwise, the import will be blocked to prevent playback or reading errors.

- **Manga / Comics**: `.zip`, `.cbz`, folders with image files (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`, etc.).
- **Novel**: `.epub`, `.txt`.
- **Video / Anime**: `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.ts`, `.webm`, `.avi`, `.m3u8`.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you do not explicitly select a category and leave it as **Auto-detect**, Kototoro will attempt to guess the content type based on the file extension. However, selecting the correct type explicitly is highly recommended when dealing with `.txt` files or mixed media folders.

## Directory Structures

If you have multiple files, Kototoro can import them as comprehensive chapters/episodes using the "Import Folder" modes.

### 1. Single Folder Import (One Series)
Use **"Import folder (Single item)"** when your folder contains chapters or episodes of exactly one series.
The folder name will become the Title of the Series, and every file inside is treated as a chapter or episode.

**Example for Anime:**
```text
[Folder] Attack on Titan Season 1/
  ├─ Episode 01.mp4
  ├─ Episode 02.mp4
  └─ Episode 03.mkv
```

**Example for Novel:**
```text
[Folder] My Web Novel/
  ├─ Chapter 1.txt
  ├─ Chapter 2.txt
  └─ Chapter 3.txt
```

### 2. Multiple Folders Import (Multiple Series)
Use **"Import folder (Multiple items)"** when you have a large library folder containing many different series.
Each sub-folder will act as an independent series, and the files within them act as chapters/episodes.

**Example:**
```text
[Folder] My Local Anime Library/  (Select this folder during import)
  │
  ├─ [Folder] Naruto/
  │    ├─ Ep01.mp4
  │    └─ Ep02.mp4
  │
  └─ [Folder] Bleach/
       ├─ Ep01.mkv
       └─ Ep02.mkv
```
> [!TIP]
> In "Multiple items" mode, any loose standalone media files (`.mp4`, `.epub`) located at the root of the selected directory will also be imported individually as their own series, adopting the file name as the title.
## Metadata and `index.json`

Kototoro supports reading metadata and custom information through an `index.json` file. 

### Does it recognize `index.json`?
**Yes.** If your folder or `.zip`/`.cbz` file contains a properly formatted `index.json` file at its root, the local parser will automatically read it during the import process. It maps custom titles, authors, descriptions, cover images, tags, and chapter groupings directly to your library.

### Is `index.json` generated automatically?
**Yes.** While generating the display data dynamically from the folder structures and file names during a local import or a library scan, Kototoro will automatically synthesize and save a new `index.json` inside the content folder if one is not already present. This ensures that a baseline metadata file is always available.

### Can users customize information?
**Yes.** Since an `index.json` is automatically generated for your local content, you can easily customize its information:
1. **File Editing:** Navigate to the content folder in your file manager and manually edit the `index.json` file. You can change the title, authors, cover pointers, tags, and chapter groupings. Kototoro will strictly respect your custom JSON definitions upon the next library scan.
2. **In-App Updates:** Depending on the tracker/metadata providers, some updates can also be synced automatically or manually adjusted through the Kototoro interface.
## How to Import
1. Go to **Settings > Content Sources > Local Storage**.
2. Tap the **+** (Plus) or **Import** button.
3. Choose the target **Content Type** (Manga, Novel, or Video) at the top of the dialog.
4. Select whether you are importing a single file, a single folder, or a multi-folder library.
5. The system will copy the files into its internal tracking structure. Once the notification indicates completion, you will find your items in your library.
